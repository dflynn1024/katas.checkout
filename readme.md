# Kata: Supermarket Checkout

Create a supermarket checkout that calculates the following prices for items:

1. Constant price:
   1. Can of Beans - $0.65
2. Different price for different amount:
   1. Avocado - $1.25, 3 avocados - $3
   2. Can of Soda - $2.05, Buy two, get one free

For example, a sale might be:

* 2 x Can of Beans
* 5 x Avocados
* 4 x Can of Soda

Create a model to accommodate these rules and corresponding calculations.

Use SOLID, TDD.
